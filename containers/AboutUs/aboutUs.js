                We are The Black Gasolines, a theatrical rock band founded by 
                Lukas Debeerst and Bradley Remorie in 2016. After our debut EP 
                “Dopamine Rush” in 2018, we’ve changed our drummer to Justin Bruggeman 
                and went on a quest to play as much as possible. We played more than 45 
                concerts each year with stops in Ghent, Antwerp, Amsterdam and London and 
                released 2 singles “Long Way Suicide” and “Kangaroo Days”.
